# A03_wrapped

Converted a AO3 wrapped notebook on colab (see [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1lzlj16/2025_ao3_wrapped_beta_testing)) to a JS bookmarklet.

Usage: (can't share the bookmarklet link directly in GitHub since they sanitaize `javascript:` URLs)
1. You can copy the AO3_wrapped.js and run it via console or paste the code into a bookmarklet creator ([example](https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/))
2. With either method, navigate to AO3 (make sure you're logged in!) and then click the bookmarklet/run the code.
3. It will prompt for a year and your username (could probably also scrape this tbh)
4. then it will run the queries in the background (takes a few minutes) and then display the (text) results in a dialog box
